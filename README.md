> ### CodeIgniter4 codebase containing real world examples api (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc).

### [Demo](http://codeigniter4-realworld-api.herokuapp.com/)
See how the exact same Medium.com clone (called CodeIgniter4 Realworld API).  This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully functional REST API built with **CodeIgniter4**, including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

Hope you'll find this example helpful. Pull requests are welcome!

# Getting started

## Installation

Please check the official CodeIgniter4 installation guide for server requirements before you start. [Official Documentation](https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/installation/index.html)


Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/agungsugiarto/codeigniter4-realworld-api.git

Switch to the repo folder

    cd codeigniter4-realworld-api

Install all the dependencies using composer

    composer install

Copy the example env file and make the required configuration changes in the .env file

    cp .env.example .env

Run the database migrations (**Set the database connection in .env before migrating**)

    php spark migrate

Start the local development server

    php spark serve

You can now access the server at http://localhost:8080

**TL;DR command list**

    git https://github.com/agungsugiarto/codeigniter4-realworld-api.git
    cd codeigniter4-realworld-api
    composer install
    cp .env.example .env
    
**Make sure you set the correct database connection information before running the migrations** [Environment variables](#environment-variables)

    php spark migrate
    php spark serve

## Database seeding

**Populate the database with seed data with relationships which includes users, articles, comments, tags, favorites and follows. This can help you to quickly start testing the api or couple a frontend and start using it with ready content.**

Run the database seeder and you're done

    php spark db:seed DatabaseSeeder

***Note*** : It's recommended to have a clean database before seeding. You can refresh your migrations at any point to clean the database by running the following command

    php spark migrate:refresh

# Testing API

Run the CodeIgniter4 development server

    php spark serve

The api can now be accessed at

    http://localhost:8080/api

Request headers

| **Required** 	| **Key**              	| **Value**            	|
